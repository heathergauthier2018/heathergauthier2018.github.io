          This project is a multi-page informational site about Washington State that showcases
          semantic HTML, modern CSS layout (Flexbox &amp; Grid), and small vanilla JavaScript

    <!-- WHY I BUILT THIS -->
    <section class="case-section">
      <h2>Why I Built This Site</h2>
      <p>
        This project was completed as part of WGU’s D277 Front-End Web Development course.
        The assignment asked students to create a multi-page informational site that
        demonstrates core front-end development skills without using frameworks.
      </p>
      <p>
        I chose Washington State as the subject and built the entire project from scratch,
        focusing on semantic structure, responsive layout, and accessibility. Once the assignment
        was complete, I felt the final product clearly represented my strengths in foundational
        front-end skills, so I deployed it to GitHub to showcase it in my portfolio as-is.
      </p>
    </section>

    <!-- FEATURES & EXPERIENCE -->
    <section class="case-section">
      <h2>Project Overview &amp; Experience</h2>
      <p>
        The site is organized across multiple pages, each focusing on a different aspect of
        Washington State (overview, regions, attractions). It is intentionally simple, clear,
        and informational—mirroring the structure of real-world tourism or educational sites.
      </p>

      <ul class="case-list">
        <li>
          <strong>Multi-page architecture.</strong>
          Each page has a clear purpose and uses consistent navigation so users always know where they are.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Fully semantic HTML.</strong>
          Elements like <code>&lt;header&gt;</code>, <code>&lt;nav&gt;</code>, <code>&lt;main&gt;</code>,
          and <code>&lt;footer&gt;</code> create an accessible and meaningful structure.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Readable content layout.</strong>
          Text is organized with hierarchy, spacing, and imagery to support scanning and comprehension.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Alt-tagged imagery.</strong>
          Every image includes thoughtful alt text for screen readers.
        </li>
      </ul>
    </section>

    <!-- LAYOUT & DESIGN -->
    <section class="case-section">
      <h2>Layout &amp; Visual Design</h2>
      <p>
        The site uses CSS Flexbox and Grid to create a flexible, responsive layout that adapts
        to mobile, tablet, and desktop screens. Visual decisions emphasize clarity and stability.
      </p>

      <div class="case-grid">
        <article class="case-card">
          <h3>Responsive Grid</h3>
          <p>
            Cards and page sections rearrange fluidly to remain readable on all screen sizes.
          </p>
        </article>
        <article class="case-card">
          <h3>Consistent Visual Rhythm</h3>
          <p>
            Typography, spacing, and layout styles are applied consistently to create a unified feel.
          </p>
        </article>
        <article class="case-card">
          <h3>Accessible Color Choices</h3>
          <p>
            Colors were chosen with contrast and readability in mind, following accessibility best practices.
          </p>
        </article>
        <article class="case-card">
          <h3>Navigation &amp; Feedback</h3>
          <p>
            Simple navigation patterns and hover cues help guide the user through the site.
          </p>
        </article>
      </div>
    </section>

    <!-- INTERACTIVITY & ACCESSIBILITY -->
    <section class="case-section">
      <h2>Interactivity &amp; Accessibility</h2>
      <p>
        JavaScript was used only where necessary to add small enhancements. Because the project
        emphasizes fundamentals, most of the site is powered by clean HTML and CSS.
      </p>

      <ul class="case-list">
        <li>Small interactive elements improve responsiveness and feedback.</li>
        <li>Keyboard-friendly navigation and focus states support accessibility.</li>
        <li>Meaningful alt text and ARIA attributes help screen reader users.</li>
      </ul>
    </section>

    <!-- TECH DECISIONS & ROLE -->
    <section class="case-section">
      <h2>Technical Decisions &amp; My Role</h2>
      <p>
        This was a solo course project where I planned, designed, and built the site from start
        to finish. It demonstrates my foundational strengths and understanding of the front-end
        development process.
      </p>

      <div class="case-split">

    <section class="case-section">
      <h2>What This Project Demonstrates</h2>
      <p>
        This project remains in my portfolio because it clearly demonstrates my mastery of
        front-end fundamentals at the time of completion. It showcases my ability to:
      </p>
      <ul class="case-list">
        <li>Build a structured multi-page website from scratch.</li>
        <li>Use semantic HTML to create accessible, meaningful sections.</li>
        <li>Apply responsive design patterns using Flexbox &amp; Grid.</li>
        <li>Design and write clear, readable CSS.</li>

      </ul>
      <p>
        While Dear Self and Cocktail Finder are evolving applications, this project stands
        proudly as a completed example of my foundation in front-end development.
