        <p class="case-lead">
          Dear Self is a journaling app built in React that focuses on warmth, accessibility,
          and emotional safety. It started with a simple idea: offer one meaningful affirmation
          and a related challenge each day, and give the user a private space to process how it
          went. From there, it grew into a calm, customizable journaling environment where they
          can write about the challenge, their day, or anything on their mind.
        </p>
        <p class="case-lead">
          The app is currently a work in progress; the live demo shows Version 1 of the experience
          while I continue building out the theme studio, calendar views, and deeper reflection tools
          that give users even more control over how their space looks and how they choose to express
          themselves.

    <!-- WHY I BUILT THIS -->
    <section class="case-section">
      <h2>Why I Built Dear Self</h2>
      <p>
        The very first version of Dear Self was just a daily affirmation and a matching challenge.
        I wanted more than a quote you read once and forget. The goal was to offer a small,
        kind sentence to carry through the day, and then pair it with a gentle nudge that helps
        the user actually live that affirmation in a concrete way.
      </p>
      <p>
        The journal began as a place to record how the challenge went — what they tried, what felt
        hard, what felt good. Over time, that space has intentionally widened. Now, the hope is
        that users might write multiple types of entries: one about the challenge itself, another
        about their day, or something completely unrelated that they just need to get out of their
        head. Dear Self is meant to feel like a space that is entirely theirs.
      </p>
      <p>
        I built this project to combine my interests in mental health, accessibility, and cozy
        digital spaces with my growth as a front-end developer. I’m especially interested in
        giving users more control — over how their journal looks, how they structure their
        reflection, and which tools they lean on. The affirmation and challenge are the starting
        point, but the experience is designed so users can harness the tools in whatever way
        best supports their day.
      </p>
      <p>
        The long-term goal is for Dear Self to become a place where users can return over time
        to see their emotional journey as a gentle record of days they showed up for themselves,
        rather than a strict habit tracker or productivity dashboard.
      </p>
    </section>

    <!-- FEATURES / EXPERIENCE -->
    <section class="case-section">
      <h2>Features &amp; Experience</h2>
      <p>
        Dear Self is designed to feel more like opening a favorite notebook than logging into an app.
        Each session is anchored around a “Daily Moment” — a paired affirmation and challenge — and a
        digital paper space where users can respond however they choose. They might write about the
        challenge, their day, a memory, or a mix of all three. All data is private and stored locally
        in the browser.
      </p>

      <div class="case-grid">
        <article class="case-card">
          <h3>Daily Moment</h3>
          <p>
            A curated affirmation + challenge pair appears only when the user opens the app
            on a new day. The affirmation offers something good to bring into their day,
            while the challenge is intentionally small and realistic — a way to live the
            affirmation instead of just reading it once and moving on.
          </p>
        </article>
        <article class="case-card">
          <h3>Digital Paper Journal</h3>
          <p>
            The writing area mimics real paper with subtle textures, generous line spacing,
            and ink-style fonts. Users can adjust fonts, text size, alignment, and line height
            to make the space feel like theirs, whether they are reflecting on the challenge,
            unpacking their day, or simply brain-dumping whatever is on their mind.
          </p>
        </article>
        <article class="case-card">
          <h3>Soft Customization</h3>
          <p>
            Dear Self is built to become more customizable over time. Even in Version 1,
            users can choose from multiple aesthetic themes and tweak details like ink color,
            paper style, and layout. Preferences persist via <code>localStorage</code>,
            so their journal always opens in a space that feels familiar and personal.
          </p>
        </article>
        <article class="case-card">
          <h3>Gentle Streaks</h3>
          <p>
            A local streak system thanks users for showing up without scolding them
            for missed days. Streaks reset quietly with no guilt-driven messaging.
            The focus is on the relationship with the Daily Moments and entries,
            not on maintaining a perfect record.

    <!-- CURRENT VERSION -->
    <section class="case-section">
      <h2>Current Version (V1) — What’s Built</h2>
      <p>
        Version 1 focuses on getting the core loop right: one Daily Moment, a calm home page,
        and a comfortable writing surface powered by a data model that can grow with future features.
      </p>

      <ul class="case-list">
        <li>
          <strong>Today page with Daily Moment.</strong>
          Affirmation + challenge are pulled from a curated set and displayed with a
          soft, card-style layout. The system ensures there is a single Daily Moment per day,
          so the experience feels focused rather than overwhelming.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Affirmation &amp; challenge content system.</strong>
          Early content is structured in a way that can later support themes and categories
          (for example, growth, rest, boundaries), while still remaining simple enough for
          local, front-end-only storage.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Journal entry system.</strong>
          Users can write freeform entries, change font family, size, line spacing, and
          choose between several “paper” styles to match their mood and writing style.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Theme + appearance controls.</strong>
          Early theme work includes pastel palettes, gentle textures, and light/dark styling
          applied consistently across the Today page and journal.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Local persistence.</strong>
          Entries, preferences, and streak information are stored in <code>localStorage</code>
          so the experience feels continuous between sessions without requiring an account.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Streak badge (early version).</strong>
          A React component tracks consecutive days of use and surfaces a soft “Day N”
          badge as encouragement.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Accessibility-first layout.</strong>
          Semantic structure, focus states, readable contrast, and reduced-motion-friendly
          effects guided the UI decisions.
        </li>
      </ul>
    </section>

    <!-- TECH DECISIONS & ROLE -->
    <section class="case-section">
      <h2>Technical Decisions &amp; My Role</h2>
      <p>
        Dear Self is an ongoing solo project where I handle design, architecture, and implementation.
        I approach it as both a learning space for React and a way to practice designing emotionally
        aware products with clear UX structure, starting from the Daily Moment engine and expanding
        outward into journaling, themes, and future tools.
      </p>

      <div class="case-split">
        <div>
          <h3>Technical Decisions</h3>
          <ul class="case-list">
            <li>
              Structured the app as a React single-page experience with routing for Today, Journal, and (future) views.
            </li>
            <li>
              Designed a Day Object model that can later support mood, gratitude, and other widgets without
              breaking existing entries.
            </li>
            <li>
              Built an affirmation + challenge system that pulls from a curated data set, ensures one Daily Moment
              per day, and ties that moment to the user’s streak and journal entries.
            </li>
            <li>
              Used <code>localStorage</code> for all persistence so users keep full control of their data on-device.
            </li>
            <li>
              Built a theme and appearance system that uses CSS custom properties to flow colors and textures
              through the UI.
            </li>
            <li>
              Prioritized accessibility from the start with semantic markup, focus management, and readable typography.
            </li>

    <!-- FUTURE ENHANCEMENTS -->
    <section class="case-section">
      <h2>Future Enhancements</h2>
      <p>
        The long-term vision for Dear Self is a fully featured, emotionally aware journaling
        environment. Future work focuses on giving users even more control over how their space
        looks, what tools they can use, and how they choose to interact with the Daily Moment
        each day — while introducing a secure account system for syncing and a few gentle
        supportive features like soundscapes and reminders.
      </p>

      <div class="case-grid">
        <article class="case-card">
          <h3>Richer Theme Studio</h3>
          <p>
            Turn the existing theme work into a full “studio” where users can choose
            from aesthetic packs (coquette, earthbound, celestial, etc.) or handcraft
            their own themes with colors, textures, and typography, making the space
            feel uniquely theirs.

        <article class="case-card">
          <h3>Calendar &amp; Journey Views</h3>
          <p>
            Introduce a calendar that only creates days when the user opens the app,
            plus a Journey page that visualizes moods, gratitude, Daily Moments, and streaks as a
            gentle emotional timeline instead of hard analytics.
          </p>
        </article>
        <article class="case-card">
          <h3>Widgets for Deeper Reflection</h3>
          <p>
            Add optional mood, gratitude, nightly review, and “one sentence for today”
            widgets that attach to each Day Object without overwhelming the main journal,
            so users can pick and choose what supports them best.
          </p>
        </article>
        <article class="case-card">
          <h3>Dark &amp; Candle Mode Polish</h3>
          <p>
            Refine dark mode into a warm, candlelit experience with softer contrasts,
            amber ink, and cozy textures for late-night writing and quiet reflection.
          </p>

        <article class="case-card">
          <h3>Accounts &amp; Cloud Sync</h3>
          <p>
            Move from a purely local experience to an optional account-based model backed by a
            real database (for example, Firebase). Signed-in users would be able to sync their
            affirmations, entries, themes, and settings securely across devices while still
            keeping Dear Self focused on privacy, emotional safety, and user control.

            Explore soft ambient soundscapes (like rain, fireplace crackle, or evening wind)
            and opt-in reminders that feel more like invitations than alerts. The goal is to
            support users in building a quiet ritual with Dear Self — for example, a gentle
            evening reminder paired with a calming sound — without pressure or notification
            overload.
