      <p>
        I’m a software engineering student and QA-certified tester with an ITIL 4 Foundation certification who enjoys building
        thoughtful, user-centered web experiences. I’m still exploring which path in tech I’ll
        ultimately pursue, but I’m drawn to the places where design, problem-solving, and careful
        testing meet.
      </p>
      <p>
        My background in software testing shaped the way I approach development: I think in terms
        of clarity, edge cases, accessibility, and how real people move through a product. Whether
        I’m designing a journaling experience or experimenting with an API-driven tool, I focus on
        structure, readability, and creating interactions that feel intuitive and supportive.
      </p>
      <p>
        The projects on my portfolio are just a snapshot of what I’m building right now. I’m also
        developing larger applications behind the scenes, including interactive maps, exploration
        tools, and small game experiences. I enjoy learning by creating, and each project gives me
        new space to grow my skills and explore different areas of software engineering.
      </p>
      <p>
        Long-term, I hope to grow into a remote software engineering role where I can keep learning,
        contribute to meaningful products, and continue building creative projects of my own. I’m
        motivated by the freedom that tech can provide, including the ability to support my family, be
        present for my kids, and create tools that make life a little easier or gentler for the
        people who use them.
      </p>
