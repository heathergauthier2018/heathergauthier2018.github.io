        <h1 class="case-title">Cocktail Finder — Random Generator + Search Explorer</h1>
        <p class="case-lead">
          Cocktail Finder is a single-page web application that helps users explore cocktails in two ways:
          generating a random drink or searching for something specific. Favorites are saved locally,
          allowing users to build a personal list without creating an account.
        </p>
        <p class="case-lead">
          The project is an active work in progress; the live demo reflects the current iteration while I
          continue refining the interface, improving the mobile experience, enhancing accessibility, and
          tightening the code structure.

    <!-- WHY I BUILT THIS -->
    <section class="case-section">
      <h2>Why I Built This</h2>
      <p>
        I created Cocktail Finder to strengthen my JavaScript fundamentals while working with a real public API.
        I wanted a project that would let me practice client-side state management, DOM updates, and building a
        small single-page experience without relying on a framework. It also gave me a chance to make concrete
        UI and accessibility decisions on a project I fully own from idea to deployment.
      </p>
    </section>

    <!-- FEATURES -->
    <section class="case-section">
      <h2>Features</h2>
      <p>
        Cocktail Finder is designed to feel like a small, focused tool instead of a sprawling site. Users can:
      </p>
      <ul class="case-list">
        <li>Generate a fully detailed random cocktail, including image, ingredients, glass type, and instructions.</li>
        <li>Search for cocktails by full or partial name using TheCocktailDB API.</li>
        <li>Save cocktails to a personal favorites list powered by <code>localStorage</code>.</li>
        <li>Use a clean, desktop-first layout, with mobile refinements planned as a future enhancement.</li>
      </ul>

      <div class="case-grid">
        <article class="case-card">
          <h3>Random Cocktail Mode</h3>
          <p>
            One click triggers an API call to TheCocktailDB and displays a new drink with its
            name, image, glass type, ingredients, and step-by-step instructions. This mode is meant
            to encourage discovery when the user doesn’t know what they’re in the mood for.
          </p>
        </article>
        <article class="case-card">
          <h3>Search Mode</h3>
          <p>
            Users can search by cocktail name, even with partial matches. Results are shown as a list
            of cards that highlight key details and can be favorited for later. This supports both
            revisiting known drinks and exploring new ones by name.
          </p>
        </article>
        <article class="case-card">
          <h3>Favorites System</h3>
          <p>
            Favorited cocktails are stored in <code>localStorage</code>, so they persist across sessions
            on the same device. Users can build a simple “go-to” list without needing a back-end,
            account system, or sign-in flow.
          </p>
        </article>
        <article class="case-card">
          <h3>Layout &amp; UI</h3>
          <p>
            The current layout is optimized primarily for desktop browsers with clear hierarchy and spacing.
            Improving the mobile layout and adding more refined responsive behavior is part of the planned
            next round of enhancements.

    <!-- TECH & ROLE -->
    <section class="case-section">
      <h2>Technical Decisions &amp; My Role</h2>
      <p>
        This project started as a way to practice working with a public API and managing state in a small
        vanilla JavaScript codebase, and it grew into a focused single-page app where I owned both the
        technical and UX decisions.
      </p>

      <div class="case-split">
        <div>
          <h3>Technical Decisions</h3>
          <ul class="case-list">
            <li>Structured the app as a single-page experience, toggling Random and Search views on one HTML page instead of loading separate routes.</li>
            <li>Used <code>fetch()</code> to integrate TheCocktailDB API and added basic error handling and empty-state messaging for missing or invalid results.</li>
            <li>Implemented favorites via <code>localStorage</code> so users can revisit saved cocktails without an account or back-end.</li>
            <li>Separated DOM update logic from data formatting to keep the JavaScript easier to follow and maintain as the project evolves.</li>
            <li>Focused on clear typography, contrast, and keyboard-focus states to improve accessibility for keyboard and screen-reader users.</li>
          </ul>
        </div>
        <div>
          <h3>My Role &amp; Stack</h3>
          <ul class="case-list">
            <li>Designed the overall user flow for Random, Search, and Favorites.</li>
            <li>Built the UI with semantic HTML and custom CSS.</li>
            <li>Wrote all JavaScript for view switching, API requests, and favorites management.</li>
            <li>Deployed the project using GitHub Pages and iterated based on manual testing.</li>
          </ul>
          <h4>Tech Stack</h4>
          <ul class="case-list">
            <li>HTML, CSS, Vanilla JavaScript (ES6+)</li>
            <li>TheCocktailDB API</li>
            <li><code>localStorage</code> for client-side persistence</li>
            <li>VS Code, Git, GitHub, GitHub Pages</li>
          </ul>

    <!-- FUTURE IDEAS -->
    <section class="case-section">
      <h2>Future Enhancements</h2>
      <p>
        Cocktail Finder is intentionally small, but there’s plenty of room to grow it into a more powerful,
        still-approachable cocktail tool. These ideas focus on better discovery, organization, and usability,
        especially on smaller screens.
      </p>

      <div class="case-grid">
        <article class="case-card">
          <h3>Advanced Filtering</h3>
          <p>
            Add filtering by ingredient, category, or glass type so users can narrow down results more efficiently.
            For example, they could view only “whiskey” drinks in a rocks glass or browse light, fruity options.
          </p>
        </article>
        <article class="case-card">
          <h3>Ingredient-Based Navigation</h3>
          <p>
            Enable ingredient-based navigation (e.g., clicking “lime” or “rum” on a cocktail card shows other cocktails
            that include that ingredient), turning each drink into a jumping-off point for exploring the rest of the API.
          </p>
        </article>
        <article class="case-card">
          <h3>Tags &amp; Favorites Organization</h3>
          <p>
            Introduce tags or labels (like “party”, “summer”, or “cozy”) for organizing favorites or grouping cocktails
            by theme, making it easier to build go-to lists for different moods or occasions.
          </p>
        </article>
        <article class="case-card">
          <h3>Surprise Me (Within a Category)</h3>
          <p>
            Add a “surprise me within a category” option so users can ask for a random mocktail, a summer drink,
            or a tequila-based cocktail and get more targeted recommendations than the global random mode.
          </p>
        </article>
        <article class="case-card">
          <h3>Mobile Polish &amp; Micro-Animations</h3>
          <p>
            Improve the mobile layout and spacing, and add subtle animations or transitions for card loading,
            favorites, and view switching to create a more polished feel and better usability on smaller screens.
          </p>
        </article>
        <article class="case-card">
          <h3>Non-Alcoholic Mode</h3>
          <p>
            Add a non-alcoholic mode toggle that filters results down to mocktails and low- or no-alcohol drinks,
            making Cocktail Finder more inclusive for users who don’t drink alcohol or want better alcohol-free options.
